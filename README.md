Nexus is a scaled Scrum framework designed for organizations that need to scale Agile and Scrum practices across multiple teams working on a single product. Nexus extends the core Scrum framework to address the challenges of large-scale software development while maintaining the simplicity and empiricism of Scrum. In this guide, I'll introduce you to Nexus and its key components and principles.

### Key Components of Nexus:

#### 1. Nexus Integration Team (NIT):

- The Nexus Integration Team is responsible for ensuring collaboration, integration, and alignment among multiple Scrum teams within the Nexus. The NIT consists of representatives from each Scrum Team, including Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and members.

#### 2. Nexus Sprint Backlog:

- The Nexus Sprint Backlog is a single, prioritized backlog that contains work items from all Scrum Teams within the Nexus. It ensures that teams are working on the most valuable items to achieve the Nexus Sprint Goal.

#### 3. Nexus Daily Scrum:

- The Nexus Daily Scrum is a daily coordination event that brings together members from different Scrum Teams to discuss dependencies, integration issues, and progress toward the Nexus Sprint Goal.

#### 4. Nexus Sprint Review:

- The Nexus Sprint Review is an event where all Scrum Teams within the Nexus come together to inspect and adapt the integrated increment and gather feedback from stakeholders.

#### 5. Nexus Sprint Retrospective:

- The Nexus Sprint Retrospective is a regular event for Scrum Teams to reflect on their collaboration and identify improvements that can enhance their ability to deliver an integrated increment.

#### 6. Nexus Guide:

- The Nexus Guide serves as the official guide to implementing the Nexus framework. It provides detailed guidance on roles, events, and artifacts and how they work together to scale Scrum.

### Key Principles of Nexus:

#### 1. Transparency:

- Nexus emphasizes transparency across all teams, ensuring that everyone has a shared understanding of the product, progress, and impediments.

#### 2. Accountability:

- Each Scrum Team within the Nexus is accountable for delivering a portion of the product increment. The Product Owner is accountable for the entire product backlog.

#### 3. Inspection and Adaptation:

- Nexus promotes continuous inspection and adaptation at all levels. Scrum Teams inspect their own work, and the Nexus Integration Team inspects the integration of their work.

#### 4. Empiricism:

- Nexus relies on empiricism, which means decisions are based on observations and data. This includes regular inspection of the integrated increment and gathering feedback from stakeholders.

### Steps to Implement Nexus:

1. **Identify the Product:** Determine which product or set of products will be the focus of Nexus.

2. **Form Scrum Teams:** Organize cross-functional Scrum Teams, each with its Scrum Master, Product Owner, and members.

3. **Appoint a Nexus Integration Team (NIT):** The NIT consists of representatives from each Scrum Team and is responsible for ensuring collaboration, integration, and alignment.

4. **Create a Single Product Backlog:** Consolidate all work items into a single prioritized product backlog, managed by the Product Owner.

5. **Hold Nexus Events:** Conduct Nexus Daily Scrum, Nexus Sprint Review, and Nexus Sprint Retrospective in addition to regular Scrum events.

6. **Inspect and Adapt:** Continuously inspect the integrated increment, gather feedback from stakeholders, and adapt the Nexus framework and product backlog as needed.

Nexus is designed to be lightweight and adaptable to different organizational contexts. It provides a structured approach to scaling Scrum while preserving the core principles and practices of Scrum. Implementing Nexus can help organizations achieve greater collaboration, coordination, and value delivery across multiple Scrum teams working on a single product.
